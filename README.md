### Project description
The project implements the following brain teasing games:
+ calc - guess the value of the arithmetic expression
+ even - guess the parity of the number
+ gcd - guess the grater common divisor of the two numbers
+ prime - guess whether the number is prime
+ prog - guess the missing term of the arithmetic progression

To install on Linux use

`$ `

To play on Linux use

+ for even `$ brain-even`
+ for gcd `$ brain-gcd`
+ for prime `$ brain-prime`
+ for prog `$ brain-progress`
