### Project description
The project implements the following brain teasing games:
+ calc - guess the value of the arithmetic expression
+ even - guess the parity of the number
+ gcd - guess the grater common divisor of the two numbers
+ prime - guess whether the number is prime
+ prog - guess the missing term of the arithmetic progression

To install on Linux use
`$ `

To play on Linux use
`$ brain-calc` for calc
`$ brain-even` for even
`$ brain-gcd` for gcd
`$ brain-prime` for prime
`$ brain-progress` for prog
